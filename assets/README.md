Place your site logo image here as `logo.png`.

Steps:

1. Save the PNG you uploaded in the chat as `assets/logo.png` (create the `assets` folder if it doesn't exist).
2. The navbar and footer now reference `assets/logo.png`.
3. Optional: add a favicon by creating a 32x32 PNG named `assets/favicon.png` and add this link to the `<head>` of `index.html`:

   <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="assets/favicon.png" />

If you'd like, I can also inline the PNG as base64 in `index.html` or convert and add a favicon for you — tell me which you prefer.
